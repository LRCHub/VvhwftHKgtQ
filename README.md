```lrc
[00:29.74] There goes my valentine again
[00:32.64] Soaked in red for what she said
[00:35.61] And now she's gone
[00:44.61] 
[00:38.06] Oh, my god, have I done it again?
[00:40.49] There's a pulse and it's deafening
[00:42.96] I can't help what I hear in my head
[00:45.69] It's the switch that I flick when he says
[01:06.19] 
[00:47.47] (Hand of blood)
[00:48.95] I don't wanna feel
[00:50.58] My heart is breaking
[00:52.54] (Hand of blood)
[00:53.92] I don't wanna see
[00:55.72] My life is burning
[01:04.72] 
[01:08.79] I saw you look away
[01:12.47] Is what you've seen too much to take
[01:14.94] Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
[01:32.94] 
[01:17.46] (I saw you run)
[01:19.35] I saw you run away
[01:22.54] Is what I've done too much to take
[01:25.00] Or are you scared of being nothing?
[01:42.50] 
[01:28.96] There's a stain on my hand and it's red
[01:31.31] Oh, my God, am I losing it?
[01:33.67] I can't help what I've done or I've said
[01:36.43] It's the buttons I push when he says
[01:54.43] 
[01:38.18] (Hand of blood)
[01:39.51] I don't wanna feel
[01:41.24] My heart is breaking
[01:43.12] (Hand of blood)
[01:44.51] I don't wanna see
[01:46.26] My life is burning
[01:55.26] 
[01:59.36] I saw you look away
[02:03.05] Is what you've seen too much to take
[02:05.61] Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
[02:23.61] 
[02:08.37] (I saw you run)
[02:10.02] I saw you run away
[02:13.19] Is what I've done too much to take
[02:15.64] Or are you scared of being nothing?
[02:33.14] 
[03:12.92] I saw you look away
[03:16.77] Is what you've seen too much to take
[03:19.39] Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
[03:37.39] 
[03:21.80] (I saw you run)
[03:23.61] I saw you run away
[03:26.72] Is what I've done too much to take.
[03:29.22] Or are you scared of being nothing?
