There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for
what she said
And now shes gone
Oh my god have i done it again
theres a pulse and its deafening
I can't help
what i hear in my head
it's the switch
that i flick when he says
Hand of blood
i don't wanna feel
my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
i don't wanna see
my life is burning
<♪>
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen
too much to take
Or are you blind
and seeing nothing
I saw you run
I saw you run away
is what i've done too much
to take or are you
scared of being nothing
There's a stain on my hand
and it's red
oh my god am i losing it
I can't help
what i've done or i said
It's the buttons
i push when he says
Hand of blood
i don't wanna feel
my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
i don't wanna see
my life is burning
<♪>
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen
too much to take
Or are you blind
and seeing nothing
I saw you run
I saw you run away
Is what i've done too much
to take or are you
scared of being nothing
<♪>
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen
too much to take
or are you blind
and seeing nothing
I saw you run
I saw you run away
Is what i've done too much
to take or are you
scared of being nothing
