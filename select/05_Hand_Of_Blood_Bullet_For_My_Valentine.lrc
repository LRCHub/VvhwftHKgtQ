[00:29.23] There goes my valentine again
[00:32.09] Soaked in red for what she said
[00:35.68] And now she's gone
[00:44.68] 
[00:37.97] Oh, my god, have I done it again?
[00:40.66] There's a pulse and it's deafening
[00:42.90] I can't help what I hear in my head
[00:45.33] It's the switch that I flick when he says
[01:05.83] 
[00:47.54] (Hand of blood)
[00:48.96] I don't wanna feel
[00:50.69] My heart is breaking
[00:52.48] (Hand of blood)
[00:53.90] I don't wanna see
[00:55.69] My life is burning
[01:04.69] 
[01:07.66] I saw you look away
[01:12.44] Is what you've seen too much to take
[01:15.09] Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
[01:33.09] 
[01:17.79] (I saw you run)
[01:19.43] I saw you run away
[01:22.40] Is what I've done too much to take
[01:24.96] Or are you scared of being nothing?
[01:42.46] 
[01:28.19] There's a stain on my hand and it's red
[01:30.97] Oh, my God, am I losing it?
[01:33.39] I can't help what I've done or I've said
[01:36.14] It's the buttons I push when he says
[01:54.14] 
[01:38.20] (Hand of blood)
[01:39.71] I don't wanna feel
[01:41.49] My heart is breaking
[01:43.11] (Hand of blood)
[01:44.62] I don't wanna see
[01:46.30] My life is burning
[01:55.30] 
[01:59.53] I saw you look away
[02:03.05] Is what you've seen too much to take
[02:05.70] Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
[02:23.70] 
[02:08.12] (I saw you run)
[02:10.02] I saw you run away
[02:13.05] Is what I've done too much to take
[02:15.43] Or are you scared of being nothing?
[02:32.93] 
[03:11.86] I saw you look away
[03:16.60] Is what you've seen too much to take
[03:19.19] Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
[03:37.19] 
[03:21.85] (I saw you run)
[03:23.58] I saw you run away
[03:26.69] Is what I've done too much to take.
[03:29.15] Or are you scared of being nothing?
